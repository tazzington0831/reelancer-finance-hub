  <h1>How to Build an Emergency Fund with Irregular Income</h1>
  <p>As a freelancer, your income may fluctuate from month to month. An emergency fund acts as a financial cushion during lean periods or unexpected expenses. Here’s how to build one even when your income isn’t consistent.</p>
  <h2>1. Determine Your Target Amount</h2>
  <p>Most financial advisors recommend saving three to six months’ worth of living expenses. Calculate your baseline monthly expenses—rent, utilities, food, insurance—and multiply by the number of months you want to cover.</p>
  <h2>2. Open a Separate Savings Account</h2>
  <p>Keeping your emergency fund separate from your checking account reduces the temptation to spend it. Look for high‑yield savings accounts that offer competitive interest rates and low fees.</p>
  <h2>3. Automate When Possible</h2>
  <p>Whenever you receive client payments, transfer a percentage directly to your emergency fund. Even small, regular contributions add up over time.</p>
  <h2>4. Budget for Lean Months</h2>
  <p>Track your income and identify the average amount you earn. Budget your expenses below that average and save the surplus during high‑income months to cover leaner periods.</p>
  <h2>5. Reduce Debt and Expenses</h2>
  <p>High‑interest debt can undermine your savings efforts. Focus on paying down credit cards and loans so you can redirect those payments toward your emergency fund.</p>
  <h2>6. Use Windfalls Wisely</h2>
  <p>When you receive larger payments or tax refunds, allocate a portion to your emergency fund. Treat unexpected income as an opportunity to accelerate your savings goal.</p>
