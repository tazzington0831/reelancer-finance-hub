  <h2>QuickBooks Self‑Employed</h2>
  <p>QuickBooks is widely used and integrates seamlessly with TurboTax. It’s ideal for freelancers who need automatic mileage tracking and quarterly tax estimates. However, it lacks advanced invoicing and time tracking features.</p>

  <h2>FreshBooks</h2>
  <p>FreshBooks offers robust invoicing, time tracking and project management tools. It’s a good fit for freelancers who bill by the hour or need to collaborate with contractors. The higher price point may not appeal to those with simple accounting needs.</p>

  <h2>Wave</h2>
  <p>Wave is a free accounting solution that provides invoicing, income and expense tracking and receipt scanning. It’s perfect for budget‑conscious freelancers but lacks advanced features such as mileage tracking.</p>
